such as probability theory and computer science. In mathematics, it is
used to solve problems involving permutations, combinations,
partitions, and other related topics.","Combinatorics is the study of counting and probability, which involves
finding the number of possible outcomes for a given set of conditions.
It is used to solve problems involving permutations, combinations, and
other related topics."
,Topology,"In mathematics, topology is the study of geometric properties of
objects such as their shape and size. It involves studying how objects
can be deformed or stretched without breaking them apart. This
includes looking at how objects can be connected together, how they
can be separated into smaller pieces, and how they can be rearranged
into different configurations.","Topology in mathematics is the study of continuous deformations and
transformations of geometric objects, such as surfaces and spaces. It
is concerned with properties that remain unchanged under these
transformations, such as connectedness, homotopy, and path-lifting."
